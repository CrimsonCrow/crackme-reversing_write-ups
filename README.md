## Reversing / Crackmes write-ups #

Write-ups of crackmes/reversing exercises

Written in CherryTree note (.ctb) format (v0.38.9_1)

**This is not a professional write-up, just teaching it to my(future)self on how I manage to solve it.**

**I'm creating this write-up as I'm solving the crackme, so the writing is very messy**

### Sources #
* noracodes https://github.com/NoraCodes/crackmes
* exrs https://github.com/wapiflapi/exrs

##### To-do #
+ put the sources of the crackmes/reversing exercises
+ edit description
+ fix to-do list
+ revise the write-ups at later date

###### Notes #
- improve your explanation, especially your english vocab
- practice markdown (RTFM or the Doc)
- research the correct terminologies please
- should I make it pdf or html format? I'll decide later
- why future self you ask? In case I stopped solving crackmes
